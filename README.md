# Java Content Repository üçµ

Welcome to my Game Development Course repository! Here you will find a collection of lessons, activities, resources, and projects that can be used to learn and practice Java programming, concepts from basic to advanced in programming in general, and game development. I am regularly updating this repository as I progress through the course, adding lessons organized from basic to advanced, with named topics and explanatory comments in each code snippet. Additionally, interesting projects are available for exploration and study.

## Repository Structure

- **Lessons:** This directory contains all the lessons from the Game Development Course, organized by topics, starting from basic and progressing progressively. Each lesson is accompanied by source code exemplifying the covered concept, along with explanatory comments.

- **Projects:** This section contains practical game development projects, covering a variety of genres and mechanics. Each project comes with a detailed description, setup and implementation instructions, and is an opportunity to apply the acquired knowledge in a more practical and meaningful way.

- **Resources:** In addition to lessons, activities, and projects, I've provided a detailed Word document about game development, covering from fundamentals to advanced techniques. This resource serves as a complementary guide to assist you in your game development learning journey.
